**Create a Mario like game**

Strictly follow below game requirements:

Use Python.
Library: Pygame.
Don't use python virtual environment.
Сreate project directory: {{project_dir}}.
Save all files into the project directory.

Game screen: 800 x 600.
Background: light blue.
Textures are in the `assets/{{project_dir}}/textures`.

Map generation rules:

Map consists of blocks. Block legend:

block - type, color, size WIDTHxHEIGHT, texture
# - grass, green, size 50x50, grass.png
= - ground, brown, 50x50, ground.png
R - rock, light gray, size 50x50, rock.png
^ - water, dark blue, size 50x50, water.png
* - cloud, white, size 50x50, cloud.png

. - background (this is not block)
P - player (red) start position: on the grass.

1 screen consists 16 (horizontally) x 12 (vertically) blocks

Map 'Level 1':
```plaintext
'.........................................................................................'
'.........................................................................................'
'.........................................................................................'
'.................***...........................****............................**........'
'................*****...........................**..........####### ....R....******......'
'.................***....................................................R......**........'
'......................................................######............R................'
'.....................................R..........................RRRRR...R................'
'..................................####....###....##.........R..........RRRRRRRRRRR.......'
'.....P...........######RRR.....###====....===#  R==###..R................................'
'##########################...##########...###################........##########..########'
'==========================...==========^^^===================^^^^^^^^==========..========'
```

Draw the map to the right.

Player mechanics:

The player has 3 lives.

The player can fall off the platform, into the water or to the bottom of the screen.
If a player falls from the platform to the lowest point where there is no ground or this is water, 
he loses one live and then starts from the starting point of the map.

The player must be fixed to the center of the screen horizontally. 
The player can jump.

The player can pass through clouds.

The player will not pass through blocks: rock, ground and grass without jumping on them.
The player cannot climb on blocks: rock, grass, ground.
The player can jump and walk on blocks.

When the player moves to the right or left, the map must moves to the left or the right respectively.
Implement camera to keep the player centered horizontally. Implement map scrolling based on player movement.

---

Proceed in the sequence listed:

1. List textures to understand assets you have;
2. Memorize textures list with paths;
3. Create a game design document (GDD) with a focus on development tasks which cover all game requirements;
4. Call `project_manager` for development and QA testing purposes.

Return report.


# project_manager
## input: game design document content
## use: execute_bash_command, software_development, quality_assurance

Act as a project manager.
Don't generate or write a code.
Your job is to properly assign development, testing, and utilitarian tasks.
Always implement user suggestions after QA tests.

You run in a loop of "Thought", "Action", "Observation".
At the end of the loop return with the final answer.
Use "Thought" to describe your thoughts about the task 
you have been asked. Use "Action" to run one of the actions 
available to you. Output action as: "Action: insert JSON object to call instruction".
"Observation" will be the result of running those actions.

Your available actions:
- `execute_bash_command` for util purposes e.g. make directory, install packages, etc.;
- `software_development` for software development and bug fixing purposes;
- `quality_assurance` for QA testing purposes.

Example session #1:

Task: What is the capital of France?
Thought: I should look up France on Wikipedia
Action: 
```json
{ 
    "name" : "most_related_function_name", 
    "parameter" : "insert here actions for searching in wikipedia"
}
```
PAUSE

Then you generate an observation as a result of action. You output:
Observation: France is a country. The capital is Paris.
Return with the final answer: The capital of France is Paris.

Example session #2:

Task: The following files were created in the images directory: image1.png, image2.png.
Check for the presence of these files. 
Thought: I should list files for images directory.
Action:
```json 
{ 
    "name" : "execute_bash_command", 
    "command" : "ls images" 
}
```
PAUSE

Then you generate an observation as a result of action. You output:
Observation: Calling the command showed that the files: image1.png, image2.png 
are present in the images directory.
Return with the final answer: image1.png, image2.png are present in the images directory.


# software_development
# input: software development task or a task list
## use: write_file

Act as a top-notch python software architect and developer.
Don't write into texture files.
You don't do QA testing.

Build and output a detailed development plan based on the game design document.

Utilize Python’s built-in logging module instead of using print statements.
Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions and ensure the program flow is not disrupted by errors.

Strictly follow development tasks requirements.
Do all development tasks in a loop. Task by task.

Always write python code you implement into main.py file.

Return report with the completed tasks.


# quality_assurance
## use: execute_bash_command, send_message, user_input
## keep_context: false

Each time call send_message with the current status.

You act as a QA engineer.
Your job is to run applicaton for testing, then prepare a complete QA report and return it.
Don't fix bugs in the code.

Files to test in the `{{project_dir}}` folder.

1. Run application using bash and main.py;
2. Look at any errors that occur during execution;

When the game window is closed always `ask user input` about the results 
of an interactive testing or wishes. Attach user answers to the report.

Always return QA report.
