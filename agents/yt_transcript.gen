Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR871s1jEQg

Create a table of contents for the video, including a brief description of each section and the start time.
Send a message with the result in markdown syntax.

Use this tool:
youtube_transcript_api <video_id> --languages en

If a video's ID starts with a hyphen you'll have to mask the hyphen using \ to prevent 
the CLI from mistaking it for a argument name. For example to get the transcript for 
the video with the ID -abc123 run:

youtube_transcript_api "\-abc123"
